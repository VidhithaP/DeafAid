### Problem Statement

Hearing-impaired individuals often face difficulties in perceiving verbal communication and recognizing 
human presence, especially in unfamiliar or public environments. Traditional hearing aids and 
communication tools do not always address the broader need for situational awarenessâ€”such as 
identifying who is speaking, what is being said, or if someone is approaching. This gap creates a 
communication barrier and increases dependency on others. Therefore, there is a need for a portable, 
intelligent module that can detect nearby people, identify visible objects, and transcribe spoken words in 
real-time to assist hearing-impaired individuals in maintaining independence and safety.

### Aim of the project

The aim of the project is to create a smart, real-time assistive device that bridges the communication gap for 
hearing-impaired individuals by integrating advanced AI technologies for visual and auditory interpretation. This 
system intends to improve accessibility, independence, and safety by enabling users to better understand their 
environment and interact with others more effectively. It is especially focused on being functional in everyday 
situations, whether at home, in public spaces, or while traveling.
